# Clonify
This is going to be a gadget-shopping website clone with custom modifications and changes in layouts. Liquid Motions take the User-Experience one step further.
The website is linked to a database and can store quite some amount of data like:

-  The Login/Register details of the users, which can be used to retreive data anytime,
-  The items added to cart by individual users,
-  Address Book to manage office and home addresses along with the time of day when they can be contacted.

Stack used:
- Django 3.0 used for Request-Handling
- HTML/CSS/Javascript used for User-Experience
